# 3D Cube Rotating

*******
This is a small simulation of a 3D cube in SFML, it is not a real 3D cube but a 2D cube that gives the appearance of being 3D.<br>
I made this code just to try to do some 3D (but nothing much) if you can use the code for something, feel free to copy it as well.<br><br>
I don't think it needs to be said but the project was made with SFML in c++.
